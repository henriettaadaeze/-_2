                && Nnamdi Benjamin Azikiwe, GCFR PC (16 November 1904 – 11 May 1996), usually referred to Zik,
                 was a Nigerian politician, statesman, and revolutionary leader who served as the 3rd 
                 governor-general of Nigeria from 1960 to 1963 and the 1st president of Nigeria during 
                 the First Nigerian Republic (1963–1966). He is regarded as the "father of Nigerian nationalism",

                   Columbia University, the University of Pennsylvania and Howard University. He contacted colonial authorities 
                   with a request to represent Nigeria at the 1932 Los Angeles Olympics since he was also a sportsperson.
